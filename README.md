# Fast Track to Python

This is the home of the Fast Track to Python class files.

## Setup Instructions

My examples will all be running in an Ubuntu virtual machine managed by Vagrant.
If you want to have the exact same environment as I'm running (same version of
Python, including IPython and the IPython notebook), you'll want to install the following:

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant 1.6.2](http://www.vagrantup.com/)

Once you have these, you'll want to clone this repository and run a couple of commands:

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/rick446/fasttrack-python.git
cd fasttrack-python
vagrant up    # This imports and boots the virtual machine
vagrant ssh   # This logs you into the virtual machine

vagrant@precise64~$ ./src/fasttrack-python/setup-environ.bash
vagrant@precise64~$ exit
~~~~
